<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p> My name is Zak, an aspiring programmer. 
    I started porgramming at the age of 12, when I first discovered python.
    I enjoy the process of programming as it is satisfying to see lines that YOU wrote come to life
    in front of you -- programming intrigues me alot!
